# CNN-From-Scratch-In-C

This is my on-going passion project

Motivation: during my time as a student, I took a data mining course that covered the basics of machine learning models, but all the work done in the class
was at a high level. I did a project in PyTorch that was a CNN for the MNIST dataset, but found myself not really understanding it. Most of what I did for the 
project was just copying what the professor had shown us to do. The result of this was that I left the class with a abstracted idea of how these things work, 
but not knowing what was going on underneath that single line of PyTorch code. So with this project I'm hoping to change that!
